# Assignment-6-Medians-and-Order-Statistics

## Overview
Some of the algorithms and data structures used in the project are Median of Medians, Randomized QuickSelect, and other standard data structures as Arrays, Matrix, Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists. Each of the algorithms is tailored to determine the quickest way to discover the component in an unordered array, and either deterministic or randomized approaches could be applied. The data structures offer basic functionality, namely, insertion, deletion and access, and they are used in different scenarios and have different purposes. The project is on learning how the algorithms and data structures work and studying their space complexity, their time complexity, and how they can be applied practically.

## Instructions to Run the Code
To execute the Code in Python one needs to have Python 3.x on the system. The Python programming language should include the libraries necessary such as random to run the Randomized QuickSelect algorithm and math to run the Median of Medians algorithm. Each of the scripts is to be stored on the local computer and launched using the terminal or command prompt. 
As an example, executing the Deterministic Algorithm.py will show the 4 th least element among the given array by deterministic method. There is output produced by each script showing how the algorithm or data structure works, whether it is the result of a selection algorithm or it is the present state of an array, matrix, stack or queue.

## Summary of Findings
The Median of Medians algorithm guarantees a worst-case time complexity of O(n) for selecting the k-th smallest element, ensuring predictable and efficient performance. The Randomized QuickSelect algorithm, while generally O(n) on average, can degrade to O(nÂ²) in the worst case if poor pivots are chosen repeatedly. Arrays allow for quick access to elements but have O(n) time complexity for insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions, making them ideal for static data. Linked Lists, on the other hand, offer efficient insertions and deletions at the beginning or end, but accessing elements requires O(n) time. Stacks and Queues provide efficient management of data in O(1) time for insertion and removal, with stacks following a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and queues following a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. All the data structures and algorithms can be utilized in various practical cases with respect to the memory space requirements, time efficiency, and dynamic data processing needs.
